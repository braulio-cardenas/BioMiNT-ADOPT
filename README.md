# BioMiNT-ADOPT

## Description
This repository contains modified code originally developed by the Regents of the University of California. The original code, described in K. G. Chan and M. Liebling's paper 'Direct inversion algorithm for focal plane scanning optical projection tomography' (Biomedical Optics Express, vol. 8, no. 11, pp. 5349-5358, 2017), has been adapted to perform 3D image reconstruction in a routine that processes the raw images collected by widefield microscopy using Arrayed-Droplet Optical Projection Tomography (ADOPT) technology.
